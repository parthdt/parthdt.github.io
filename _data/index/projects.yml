- name: Criminal Database management system in C++
  descr: "Used different file management capabilities of C++ to create a database management system to add, delete, and manage records of criminals including a secure login feature for the admin. (Included a personal rendition of reCaptcha type system to detect if human). I was responsible for the working and GUI of the whole program. This project was my first ever project, back in 12th grade, and it motivated me to purse the field of CSE."
